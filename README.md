# README.md generator


<a name="Description"></a>
## Description
This application will help guide a user to make a README.md file. I used NPM modules to help me create a prompt list of object messages that will ask the user different questions inorder to help them create a working README.md. Once the user finishes answering the prompts, their README.md file will be created and it should show up how it looks in their terminal, along with a console.log saying "sucessfully created your README.md".I used a writeFile function at the end to try and catch any errors, so that it will log a throw error to the terminal.
